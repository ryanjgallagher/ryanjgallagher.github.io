# DS 2001 Data Science Programming Practicum for Social Sciences and Humanities

## What is this course about?

Digital traces of our daily lives are increasingly recorded, aggregated, analyzed, and used to shape our experiences, and large-scale computational methods and resources for understanding human behavior are accessible like never before. These data and methods offer the potential for rich insights into society, while simultaneously introducing new ethical and infrastructural challenges. In this practicum we will:

1. Practice the skills you learn in DS2000 using applied examples drawn from the social sciences
2. Read about how data science is impacting society
3. Develop an intuition for computational social science
4. Interrogate the ethical and political ramifications of data science

The practicum will meet once a week, where we’ll discuss short readings and practice programming through hands-on tutorials and assignments. Your grade will be based on reading reflections, programming exercises, a project proposal, and a final project and presentation.

## Who is the instructor?

My name is Ryan Gallagher and I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Network Science here at Northeastern. I research online communication on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and TikTok. I’m particularly interested in how people amplify their voices online to speak against oppression and marginalization.
