# On the Job Market!

I am seeking industry data science and research positions broadly related to online communication, platform integrity, or social media.

Please see [my resume](files/Gallagher_Resume.pdf) for my professional data science experience. You are welcome to [contact me](/contact) with any relevant opportunities.


# Research

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Network Science program](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern University, and a member of the [Communication Media and Marginalization (CoMM) Lab](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/commlab) directed by [Professor Brooke Foucault Welles](http://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/). Through my research, I aim to be a computational social scientist who respects, engages, and brings together communication theory and network science. My work focuses on how individuals use online communication networks to amplify their voices, and how that amplification can resonate through online media ecologies. To that end, my research also makes advances in network science and text-as-data methodology, developing new methods to measure the complexities of online communication.

While social media has given rise to progressive movements like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, it has also allowed the proliferation of social bots, networked harassment, and coordinated information operations. My research is about how all of these entities leverage amplification online, and the consequences of that amplification for things like hashtag activism, polarization, and misinformation. In particular, I am interested in the network structure of amplification, and the recurring patterns that emerge from such amplification. By understanding these structural patterns, I hope to help social media platforms create more equitable online spaces. Women, Black people, those from the LGBTQ+ community, and many others have long had their voices excluded from the public sphere, and it is my goal to better understand amplification processes so that we may more justly promote those voices, and safeguard their communities from discursive and structural manipulation by adversarial actors.

During my Ph.D., I have interned with Facebook [Core Data Science](https://research.fb.com/teams/core-data-science/), where I worked with Dr. Monica Lee and the Political Organizations & Society team on coordinated information operations. Prior to my time at Northeastern, I completed an M.S. in mathematics at the University of Vermont. At UVM, I did research with the [Computational Story Lab](https://www.uvm.edu/storylab/) and the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) under the guidance of Professor Chris Danforth and Professor Peter Dodds. For two summers, I was also a visiting research assistant at the University of Southern California's [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/home), where I worked with Research Associate Professor Greg Ver Steeg. I hold a B.A. in mathematics from the University of Connecticut.
